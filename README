By original author:
* 1.0  Initial public release. (21 October 2014)
* 1.1  Bug fixes (30 December 2014)
*      - Oven temperature might not reach configured maximum temperature
*      - Adjusted values so learning happens faster
*      - Other minor improvements
* 1.2  Improvements (6 January 2014)
*      - Take temperature readings every 0.125s and average them.  Fixes errors
*        generated by noise from convection fans
*      - Refined learning mode so learning should happen in fewer runs
*      - Improved loop duration timer to enhance timing
*      - Moved some strings from RAM to Flash (there is only 2.5Kb of RAM)
* 1.3  No user-facing changes (19 January 2013)
*      - Fixed compiler warnings for Arduino 1.5.8
* 1.4  Added support for servos (6 February 2015)
*      - When using a servo, please connect a large capacitor (e.g. 220uF, 16V)
*        between +5V and GND to avoid a microcontroller reset when the servo
*        stall current causes the voltage to drop.  Small servos may not need
*        a capacitor
*      - Connect the servo to +5V, GND and D3
*      - The open and close positions are configured in the Settings menu
*      - The oven door will open when the reflow is done, and close at 50C.
*        The door is also closed when ControLeo2 is turned on.
* 1.5 Minor improvements (15 July 2015)
*      - Made code easier to read by using “F” macro for strings stored in flash
*      - Minor adjustments to reflow values 
*      - Restrict the maximum duty cycle for the boost element to 60%.  It
*        should never need more than this!
*      - Make thermocouple more tolerant of transient errors, including
*        FAULT_OPEN

Amendments by Hardley: 
* 1.5a      Minor UI improvements and textual changes (19 October 2015)
*           - Added setup option 'Use Servo', YES/NO 
*           - Visual representation of output ports D4 to D7 now shown as '1' to '4' 
*             on LCD during 'Output Test' and 'Setup - Output'
*           - Inhibit auto-repeat for buttons during Setup for 'Outputs' and 'Use Servo'
*           - Button debounce period check is millis() made rollover-safe
